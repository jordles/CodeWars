Our goal is to create a function that will check that for us!</p><p>Assume that the board comes in the form of a 3x3 array, where the value is <code>0</code> if a spot is empty, <code>1</code> if it is an "X", or <code>2</code> if it is an "O", like so:</p><pre><code>[[0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0]]</code></pre><p>We want our function to return:</p><ul><li><code>-1</code> if the board is not yet finished AND no one has won yet (there are empty spots),</li><li><code>1</code> if "X" won,</li><li><code>2</code> if "O" won,</li><li><code>0</code> if it's a cat's game (i.e. a draw).</li></ul><p>You may assume that the board passed in is valid in the context of a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.</p>
